**Overview**

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. This exercise is centered around predicting the survival of passengers on board based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. I've created this exercise to offer you an excellent introduction to data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this exercise is the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. It contains information about passengers, including their survival status. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, making it ideal for machine learning training and testing. 

**Usage**

This project is open for learning, experimentation, and collaboration. You are encouraged to use, modify, and extend the code to improve your data science and machine learning skills. Contributions are welcome, whether it's fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation.
